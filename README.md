# SAC + HGR on Reacher-v5

This repository contains the implementation of the work described in [*Hindsight Goal Ranking on Replay Buffer for Sparse Reward Environment*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15043) by Tung M. Luu and Chang D. Yoo. The algorithm is applied to the [Reacher-v5](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/reacher/) environment provided by Gymnasium, utilizing the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.

In particular, it is possible to use the model of simple Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) or the model which integrates HGR.
